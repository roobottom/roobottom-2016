        <p>Churchill used to call his bouts with depression his &quot;Black Dog&quot;. A huge shaggy dog that would visit him for a while.</p>
<p>I really didn&#39;t know what depression meant, I always thought it was something people said when they were a bit sad about something. It wasn&#39;t until my first year at University that I felt the crushing grip of depression.</p>
<p>For those of you that don&#39;t know; depression isn&#39;t feeling a little sad. It&#39;s a deep dark pit of despair, it grips you like a vice, squeezing your stomach sending poison round your body. That first time at University was exactly this. I couldn&#39;t face doing anything. I didn&#39;t care what I looked like, I couldn&#39;t interact with people anymore, something had broken inside me and I didn&#39;t know what it was or how to make it better.  Slowly, so slowly I came out of it. I floundered there for a while, but it did get better. </p>
<p>That was eight years ago. I remember for the longest time afterwards I was scared that It would come back, that the very act of being scared of it was going to cause it. Fear of fear itself.  I&#39;ve had other bouts of it, mostly at University, but always come out the other side, perhaps a bit stronger for the experience. </p>
<p>That brings me to today. And I&#39;m feeling low again. I wouldn&#39;t say that I was depressed because I can remember that feeling, and that was a <em>lot</em> worse. This is sporadic, occasionally punching me in the stomach when I&#39;m least expecting it. I do know I&#39;ll get better. Past experience teaches me that I <em>probably</em> wont feel like this forever. I&#39;ve just got to keep telling myself that.</p>
