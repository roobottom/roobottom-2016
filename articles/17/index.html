        <p>We watched the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387131/">Constant Gardener</a> last Tuesday night, which Paul told me was called the Uphill Gardener so really didn&#39;t want to watch it. For those who haven&#39;t seen it, I really would recommend giving it a go, I&#39;m not going to bother explaining the plot (you can read about it on imdb if you&#39;re really that interested) but suffice to say its set in Africa, and shows in no uncertain terms the sometimes brutal existence that people live. </p>
<p>The film catalysed me into writing about something I&#39;ve been thinking about for the last few weeks: How privileged I am. When McClegg got back from India, he had lots of stories about the absolute poverty that people find themselves in. I can&#39;t even begin to imagine living that life, the gulf between my luxury existence and the hand-to-mouth living that many of this world&#39;s inhabitants endure is almost insurmountable. As the old saying goes...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It could be worse</p>
</blockquote>
<p> ...and yes indeed it could be a lot worse. So this got me thinking about &quot;accident&quot; of birth. Is it pure chance that you are born into the family and circumstances you have? Does God control it? If so, it may seem a little unfair that I&#39;m enjoying my decadent life while there are people suffering all over the world from a variety of different evils. I guess we could look at the &quot;big&quot; picture and say that everyone is dying, and the only purpose of this life is to drive us closer to our maker / the answers / any other generic thing that we as a species seek on a day-to-day basis. I&#39;ll admit, I don&#39;t have the first idea.</p>
