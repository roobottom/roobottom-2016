        <p>Sunday saw me and Katie meeting half-way between our two home towns in Oxford (yeah, long distance relationships are a bitch). And man, the weather for late September was amazing! So off we trottled on the open top bus, and had a day of touristy-magic. Including a trip to the <a href="http://www.theturftavern.co.uk/">Turf Tavern</a>, a pub which was unsurprisingly full of American tourists and Oxford students <em>not</em> having the kind of conversations that I remember from University. </p>
<p>But not <em>just</em> that, oh no, not me and Katie! We went all out crazy-go-nuts on the tourist trail stopping off at the <a href="http://www.oxfordstory.co.uk">Oxford Story</a> a trip back 900 years into Oxford history, and then (much to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/248933596/">Katie&#39;s delight</a>) a bit of shopping at <a href="http://www.sheepshop.com">Alice&#39;s Shop</a>. But, I think the pinnacle of the day was <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/246535043/">Oxford Castle Mound</a>. </p>
<p>Not that the mound itself was that amazing, just a lot of dirt, but the security system for keeping people who&#39;d not paid the one pound entry fee was pretty much state of the art. To get on the mound you first have to go in the shop and buy yourself a ticket. Upon exiting the shop you then make your way to the mound itself. Before ye can pass, ye must buzz the buzzer on the 5 foot (possibly electrified) gate. Then, when your identification has been verified using a series of voice and DNA checks, the gate is opened electronically. </p>
<p>As we came down the mound we passed a guy who&#39;d obviously missed the sign that said: &quot;This mound costs a pound&quot; and was chased down by the huge guy who worked in the shop. I wouldn&#39;t have liked to get on the wrong side of him! </p>
<p>So was the mound worth a pound? Well, we damn well made sure we got our money&#39;s worth! A whole 30 minutes we sat on the mound. It was quite a moving experience.</p>
