        <p>For too long I have put off writing this post, and for too long I have stagnated in my Christian faith. The Bible says...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you confess with your mouth, &quot;Jesus is Lord,&quot; and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, as a basic statement of faith I believe that Jesus Christ is the way, the truth and the life of all humanity. He has given me abundant life, and given me new hope. When I returned from University in 2003, I was not a believer. In fact I cringed in embarrassment the one and only time I did make it to church. &#39;What are these nutters doing?&#39; I thought, as all around me people we&#39;re raising their arm and singing at the top of their voices in praise to their King. </p>
<p>And then I went along again to church, for a friends wedding blessing. Again, at first, I was an awkward affair. I didn&#39;t feel comfortable around these people making fools of themselves. But, right there in the middle of the midst of my embarrassment and endless questioning, God met me. I can describe this experience as nothing less than an amazing filling of God, the Holy Spirit. Things that I&#39;d pushed right down, things I didn&#39;t want to think about burst into my mind. The deep black endless pit of depression that I&#39;d suffered with the previous five years was suddenly at the forefront of my mind. But there was something else, something much bigger than that; an overwhelming Joy. </p>
<p>Tears streamed down my face as I too now worshiped God who&#39;d given me this wonderful gift. It was a lightbulb moment, a sudden realisation that where I once thought there was nothing, there was indeed something. From that day I went looking for God. It wasn&#39;t like I had that experience and that was it, I had to actively seek him out, read the Bible and spend time with Him. </p>
