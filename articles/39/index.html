        <p>Back in 2001, while I was still in midst of a degree that didn&#39;t really teach me anything, I built the first version of roobottom.com on a crappy second-hand PC.</p>
<p>Originally a &quot;Flash playground&quot; (oh, weren&#39;t <em>those</em> the days) I  redesigned and repurposed it into a blog around 2005. I&#39;d also started freelancing, launching roodesign around the same time.</p>
<p>That was twelve years ago when I was slightly shorter in the tooth and smaller of belly and working for myself, eventually making the move down south, starting full-time in London. All this rather took up my time and thoughts of a personal web project went the same way as oh-so-many pies.</p>
<p>But a man can dream, and dream I did: first of a CSS3 wonderland with garish colours and effects galore. Then, deciding that blogs were entirely too much hassle, of a stark Neverland consisting purely of some witty paragraph of text and a few links to social networks I hated.</p>
<p>Eventually I went back to basics and fleshed out exactly what I wanted: Somewhere to write the occasional blog post, showcase my work and post my photographs.</p>
<p>##Firm foundations
I built my first website because it was fun. I then got a job making websites, again because it was enjoyable. I&#39;m lucky that I get paid for what is essentially a hobby. I think that makes me a &quot;professional&quot; but the jury is still out on that one.</p>
<p>So <em>this</em> site should be the most fun of all, right? I decided to abandon any highfalutin design ideas and just stick to a few core principals that would allow me to grow this site organically.</p>
<p>First was the logo. I&#39;d been sketching some ideas around a typographic &quot;roo&quot; for a while. A kangaroo was also an obvious choice. The final result is the emblem you see at the top of this page. Not perfect by any means, but a good starting point. I&#39;ll no doubt change it as the site grows.</p>
<p>{% include figure.html class=&quot;pull-both&quot; set=&quot;logo&quot; %}</p>
<p>Secondly to start with core elements then work out from there. Creating a pleasant and easy-to-use website is key to this idea, but it&#39;s more than that. By letting the content do the work and keeping the design as subtle as possible I&#39;m striving for (but probably rarely achieving) a browsing experience that feels effortless.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve chosen <a href="http://getkirby.com/">Kirby</a> as my <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>, this has so far proven to be the perfect fit, allowing me to write content in the fantastic <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/">iA Writer</a> using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> so I always start with uncluttered, unformatted text.</p>
<p>And finally, stop procrastination and just launch the bloody thing! I&#39;ve spent entirely too many late nights debugging css to wait any longer. It&#39;s a personal project that&#39;ll grow. So here it is, warts and all.</p>
