        <p>Over the last couple of months Firefly&#39;s design team have been even busier than usual. The reason for this flurry of activity was three new themes we&#39;d be working for the big launch at the Firefly Learning Conference.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a <a href="http://fireflylearning.com/blog/firefly-learning-conference-round-up">full writeup</a> on the Firefly blog, but I wanted to share a little about the process of creating the new themes that we hope will give students, teachers and parents an improved experience while using Firefly.</p>
<p>Since the launch of Firefly 5 last year, we&#39;ve learnt a lot from our clients about what worked for them and what didn&#39;t.  We&#39;ve also worked with some fantastic schools, creating bespoke themes, which gave us a wealth of ideas of the features students and teachers really want.</p>
<p>Using this feedback, we were able to distill a clear list of the <em>type</em> of themes schools wanted, along with the customisation options that would appeal. We determined to build three new themes: One a playful, friendly theme; Another, clean and succinct; Lastly, a super minimalist theme.</p>
<p>When I joined, just over three years ago, Firefly were five people crammed into a small office hidden away in a dark corner of One Lyric Square. The design department consisted of me and a pack of half empty Sharpies. Today we&#39;re a forty strong team, with three (soon to be four) designers, with our own office in sunny Brighton. Over the summer holidays we were joined by intern <a href="http://www.adammmarsh.com">Adam Marsh</a> and, with his help, we set about designing the new themes.</p>
<p>{% include figure.html class=&quot;pull-both&quot; set=&quot;team&quot; %}</p>
<p>I&#39;m really proud of the hard work the entire team put in creating the new themes. This is just the start, we&#39;re planning a number of upgrades to these themes as well as several new themes in the coming months. </p>
