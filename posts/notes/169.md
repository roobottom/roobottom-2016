A holiday! Three of us set off from our home on the south coast, headed for cottage on the banks of the River Fal, near Truro, in Cornwall. 

All was going well until Little Roo realised it was lunchtime and all hell was let loose in the back seat. Instinct lead us to a lovely little pub in Yeovil where we enjoyed some food in the garden where Roo could have a run-around.

Many, many hours later we finally made it to the mile-long dirt track that lead to our home for the week. 

Later, with Roo in bed, we ate BBQ salmon burgers and painted with light.
