It was rather close as we parked on the dizzying hill at the Gweek Seal Sanctuary. Maybe it was the weather, or maybe it was obscene entrance price, but Roo wasn't happy. Shame, as the seals were quite cute.

In the evening Katie and I did a bit of fishing from the quay and enjoyed a beer by the fire.
