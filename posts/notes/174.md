We went to [Trelissick gardens](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/trelissick), which was lovely. Roo insisted on sitting in the luggage compartment of the push-chair, what a strange little head!

Grandad finally caught a fish! We put it back as the poor little guy was no where near big enough to eat.

Roo was cute during the Toby photoshoot. Toby belongs to Roo's child minder, but was on loan as he likes to go on holiday with all the children. Toby has a diary, so we needed a few photos to add to the entry for Roo's holiday in Cornwall.
