Last day of what's been a lovely holiday. We went to the [National Maritime Museum Cornwall](http://nmmc.co.uk/) in Falmouth. I've not been to Falmouth for years, and the place is almost unrecognisable. They filled in half the harbour and built the museum, caf√©s and shops. It was much improved, but made me feel old as I remember how long its been since I was last here.

Later on we played cards.
