I'm not a teacher, but I do work for a tech company whose goal it is to make education better.\n\nRecently the [<abbr title=\" Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\">OECD</abbr> released a report](https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/frequent-use-school-computers-impairs-learning-finds-international) that suggested that the use of technology in the classroom was having a detrimental effect on how well pupils were performing in standardised tests. As an organisation who really takes the time to try and understand education, Firefly certainly had a few thoughts on the report. One of our founders, Joe Mathewson, [shared his thoughts on the report](http://fireflylearning.com/blog/is-technology-good-or-bad-for-schools) on The BBC News Channel. \n\nAs one of the people who designs software  used by hundreds-of-thousands of students, teachers and parents every day I have a responsibility to help build something genuinely useful. What we're hearing loud-and-clear from teachers is that technology is just another tool, and is only useful when used alongside other tools and teaching methods. \n\nAs [Cat Scutt](https://twitter.com/CatScutt), Head of Learning Technology and Innovation at the Girls' Day School Trust, recently commented in her [TES article](https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/yin-and-yang-using-mobile-technology-classroom).\n\n> [E]ven if we focus on [academic achievement] alone, there is a fundamental flaw here in treating ICT as if it is a pedagogical approach in itself.\n\nIt's with this in mind that I'd like to consider what's next for the classroom. Currently, mobile is the disrupter of the technological status quo. With tablets and phones now ubiquitous, computers have entered every part of the school day. But what happens next is anyones guess; the future is up for grabs. Of course there are indicators of what's to come, decisions those in the know are making today that _may_ affect the technology of tomorrow.\n\nRecently, [Facebook brought Oculus Rift](https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10101319050523971) for $2billion. So why did they invest in a technology that seemed to have died on its arse in the mid 1980s? Well, Mark Zuckerberg certainly seems to be convinced <abbr title=\"Virtual Reality\">VR</abbr> is the next big thing in tech:\n\n> We have a lot more to do on mobile, but at this point we feel we're in a position where we can start focusing on what platforms will come next.\n\nOf course, not everyone is thrilled about Facebook's acquisition of Oculus, some even suggesting that billionaire Zuckerberg simply loved the device, so he bought the company. However, it's hard to ignore his vision, and it's pretty clear what a difference VR could make to could make to the world beyond just games.\n\nA world stuffed full of Facebook ads aside, if VR is due to replace the screen, and change the way we interact with our environment, what does this mean for the classroom?\n\n## Early adopters\n\nAn enterprising teacher could, if they wished, start using VR now. Oculus sell [Developer kits](https://www.oculus.com/en-us/dk2/) so those with coding skills can build pretty much any experience they wish.\n\nImagine a physics teacher explaining the structure of an atom to their students by immersing them in a world where she's able to zoom deep into the environment and show the students how the atoms of their desks are arranged. If that sounds far-fetched then have a look at [the tomorrow project](http://tomorrow-projects.com/classroom/), helping school children build their own 3D printable robots.\n\nI imagine some teachers and parents might see this as the ultimate nightmare scenario for the classroom; rows of students, all wearing goggles, hooked into the schools mainframe. No one speaks as information is simply downloaded into the student's brain.\n\nWhat I'm suggesting here is something quite different. Unlike mobile devices, which by their nature prevent real-world social interactions, Virtual Reality simply adds another layer on top. This augmented reality would support real-world interactions in a way that mobile never can. However, I do think that the success of VR used in this way will very much depend on how unobtrusive the VR headsets / glasses / contact lenses can be made.\n\n## Wider integration\n\nI think the mobile revolution has shown us that much of the technology innovation happening in schools is driven by students. Many schools have now adopted one to one or <abbr title=\"Bring Your Own Device\">BYOD</abbr> programmes as a direct kick-back against the tidal wave of devices being brought into school anyway, choosing to utilise technology, rather than have it serve only as a distraction.\n\nAs with anything new, there have been varying levels of success, and the OECD report is evidence of that. Personally, I think we're over the initial hump. Teachers and <abbr title=\"Senior Leadership Teams\">SLTs</abbr> are much more switched on to the potential of mobile computing devices, and their pitfalls. The same will be true of future technology. As VR becomes more prevalent in everyday life, schools will learn how best to integrate it into their classrooms.\n\n## Alternative technologies\n\nAnother technology in its infancy, and one which has huge potential for schools, is smart surfaces. I recently listened to an extremely interesting [podcast from the Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/stay-in-touch/rss/) called \"seeing clearly\", in which [Dr Dan Credgington](http://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/directory/dr-dan-credgington) gave a brief outline of how we generate light, more specifically how we use <abbr title=\"Light Emitting Diode\">LED</abbr> technology to generate light.\n\nOne of the areas he touched on was future materials, and how LEDs could be used to transform whole surfaces into light producing smart surfaces, and therefore, smart screens. Not only might this improve concentration levels in classrooms (by making the whole ceiling the light we could generate an ambient light level much closer to that of natural sunlight) but we could transform [all surfaces in the classroom into screens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodeck). \n\n## Fanciful imaginings\n\nIts fun to imagine what's next, but for now all of us at Firefly are concentrating on our next set of apps for teachers, students and parents. And, as far as I know, we've no plans to release these for Facebook VR 1.0. At least, not yet anyway.\n","html_body":"<p>One of the things I spend a lot of time thinking about is education; or, more specifically the use of technology in education.

I love it, not least as it lets me serve content directly from Github. Updating the site is as simple as pushing into my repository. I have no servers to maintain and no extra monthly costs. For a low traffic site it seems, for now at least, like the perfect solution.\n\n(figure set:artwork,class:\"pull-both\")\n\nTo me, one of the most interesting things about writing a blog is the ability to look back, to make old posts new again with an easily navigable archive section. A key part of that is the 'archives for year ...' page. However, hosting with Github pages means that I can't use plugins for Jekyll that you'd normally need to achieve this. Jekyll doesn't really offer much in the way of core functionality for archives, but with a bit of hacking you can create an archive page for every year in a way that doesn't suck.\n\nWe can use the power of [Jekyll collections](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/) to _somewhat_ automatically generate an archive page for each year your site has posts. There's three main parts to the setup:\n\n1. Configure a collection for archives.\n2. Create a post for each year for which you want an archive page.\n3. Create a layout for processing each archive post into <abbr title=\"Hyper Text Markup Language\">HTML</abbr>\n\n## Configure the archives collection\nFirst, we need to tell Jekyll about our new collection. In my site configuration file, (usually `_config.yml`) I added the following:\n\n```\ncollections:\n  archives:\n    output: true\n    permalink: /archives/:path/\n```\n\nThis tells Jekyll that we want a collection called **archives**, that we want it to output an `index.html` for each item in the collection, and we want it to do so under the `/archives` url.\n\n## Create a post per year\nOur new archives collection will read any markdown files in a folder named `_archives`, so we'll have to create a post for each year your site has posts in this folder. This is why I say that this method is only _somewhat_ automatic, however we'll only every have to worry about updating this once per year.\n\nFor example, if we want an archive page for 2015 at `archives/2015` we'd create the post `_archives/2015.md`. The only thing that's really required here is YML front matter, here's a simplified version of my `2015.md`:\n\n```\n---\ntitle: Archives for 2015\nyear: \"2015\"\nlayout: archive-year\n---\n```\n\nDon't forget the quotation marks, the reason for them will shortly become apparent.\n\n(figure set:folders,class:\"u-boxout pull-left\",image_size:small)\n\nHere's a simplified view of my local folder setup showing all the markdown files for each year in the `_archives` collection.\n\nThe `archives` folder contains the `index.html` file for the root of my archives section.\n\n\n## Archive page layout\nNow we need to define a layout that Jekyll will use to output each archive page. I did this in a layout  `_layouts/archive-year.html`. Here's a simplified version of my file:\n\n```\n---\nlayout: default\n---\n<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>\n<ul>\n{% for post in site.posts %}\n    {% capture post_year %}{{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}{% endcapture %}\n    {% if post_year == page.year %}\n            <li><a href=\"{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}\">{{ post.title }}</a></li>       \n    {% endif %}\n{% endfor %}\n</ul>\n```\n\nIts all pretty simple really. We're looping though all the posts on the site, and only displaying them if they match the target year. By the way, those quotation marks from earlier are required for matching the `post_year` with `page.year`, which both have to be strings\n\nAnd that's it. A _sort-of_ automatic way to generate an archive page-per-year.\n","html_body":"<p>I recently made the switch to <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com\">Jekyll</a> as my publishing tool for this website.

There’s three main parts to the setup:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Configure a collection for archives.</li>\n<li>Create a post for each year for which you want an archive page.</li>\n<li>Create a layout for processing each archive post into <abbr title=\"Hyper Text Markup Language\">HTML</abbr></li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"configure-the-archives-collection\">Configure the archives collection</h2>\n<p>First, we need to tell Jekyll about our new collection. In my site configuration file, (usually <code>_config.yml</code>) I added the following:</p>\n<pre><code>collections:\n  archives:\n    output: true\n    permalink: /archives/:path/\n</code></pre><p>This tells Jekyll that we want a collection called <strong>archives</strong>, that we want it to output an <code>index.html</code> for each item in the collection, and we want it to do so under the <code>/archives</code> url.</p>\n<h2 id=\"create-a-post-per-year\">Create a post per year</h2>\n<p>Our new archives collection will read any markdown files in a folder named <code>_archives</code>, so we’ll have to create a post for each year your site has posts in this folder. This is why I say that this method is only <em>somewhat</em> automatic, however we’ll only every have to worry about updating this once per year.</p>\n<p>For example, if we want an archive page for 2015 at <code>archives/2015</code> we’d create the post <code>_archives/2015.md</code>. The only thing that’s really required here is YML front matter, here’s a simplified version of my <code>2015.md</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>---\ntitle: Archives for 2015\nyear: &quot;2015&quot;\nlayout: archive-year\n---\n</code></pre><p>Don’t forget the quotation marks, the reason for them will shortly become apparent.</p>\n<p>(figure set:folders,class:”u-boxout pull-left”,image_size:small)</p>\n<p>Here’s a simplified view of my local folder setup showing all the markdown files for each year in the <code>_archives</code> collection.</p>\n<p>The <code>archives</code> folder contains the <code>index.html</code> file for the root of my archives section.</p>\n<h2 id=\"archive-page-layout\">Archive page layout</h2>\n<p>Now we need to define a layout that Jekyll will use to output each archive page. I did this in a layout  <code>_layouts/archive-year.html</code>. Here’s a simplified version of my file:</p>\n<pre><code>---\nlayout: default\n---\n&lt;h1&gt;{{ page.title }}&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n{% for post in site.posts %}\n    {% capture post_year %}{{ post.date | date: &#39;%Y&#39; }}{% endcapture %}\n    {% if post_year == page.year %}\n            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}&quot;&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;       \n    {% endif %}\n{% endfor %}\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n</code></pre><p>Its all pretty simple really. We’re looping though all the posts on the site, and only displaying them if they match the target year. By the way, those quotation marks from earlier are required for matching the <code>post_year</code> with <code>page.year</code>, which both have to be strings</p>\n<p>And that’s it. A <em>sort-of</em> automatic way to generate an archive page-per-year.</p>\n"},{"attributes":{"date":"2015-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","title":"What I talk about when I talk about beards","images":[{"image":"IMG_0184.jpg","caption":"The final product, far from perfect","set":"beard"},{"image":"IMG_0199.jpg","caption":"","set":"shave"},{"image":"IMG_0208.jpg","caption":"","set":"shave"}],"cover":"IMG_0184.jpg","introduction":"_Twiddle, twiddle, scratch, scratch, scratch_.

I've tried to name each and every one of you who made 2008 such an amazing year.\n\n## January\n\nBrr, January - There was [snow](http://flickr.com/photos/roobottommobile/2209064397), My car reached [111,111 miles](http://flickr.com/photos/roobottommobile/2209860514), and I finally got to see **Rob & Bekki Cotton** on [their barge](http://flickr.com/photos/roobottommobile/2209861688)! One thing that does standout was the trip that **Matt Clegg**, **Ben Marklew**, **John McNally** and I took to the lakes to climb [The Old Man of Coniston](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coniston_Old_Man). A top weekend that, thinking back, makes me want to do more outdoor related stuff this year. You know, like the BIG outdoors rather than the tiny stuff you get in your local high street after stepping out of the kabab shop at 3am.\n\n{% include figure.html class=\"pull-both\" set=\"coniston\" %}\n\nOn January 15th it was a year since Katie's dad passed away. **Tony Sellwood** was an amazing man... I tried to write something fitting about him shortly after he died, but couldn't find the words. Similarly now, I'm struggling, but as the second year anniversary approaches in 2009 I remember him fondly as a joker with more time for people than anyone else I've ever met. I know he's with God.\n\n## February\n\nFebruary was a bit of a mixture. At work, Glubble Family Edition was launched to a somewhat mixed reception. My abiding memory of this time was spending late nights at my parents (when our net connection was down) till 3am chatting with **Ian Hayward**, pushing pixels around interface designs. \n\nElsewhere, **Katie** and I took a long weekend to Bath. I dunno why we did, but I'm sure that we did, as I have [photographic evidence](http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/2327119659). Life at Cherrytree was fun, as always, and **Matt Clegg** managed to bake a pie with the edibility of mild steel. \n\n{% include figure.html class=\"pull-both\" set=\"cleggpie\" %}\n\n## March\n\n As I write this review, it's now that I wish I'd blogged more and taken a whole heap of photos. What did you achieve in March 2008 Jon? Oh, well, Katie and I dressed up like knobs and went to a party.\n\n{% include figure.html class=\"pull-both\" set=\"party\" %}\n\n## April\n\nApril is my birthday month (just in-case you were thinking of buying me a present) and in 2008 I experienced my first ever [Coke Float](http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/2431709662/in/datetaken/) thanks (mainly) to the fine work of **Richard Kemp**. I have yet to find a way to repay him for bringing such joy into my life. By this point of 2008 I was spending more and more of my time in Littlehampton (something to do with this random girl I met) and in [April \"LA\" got snow](http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/sets/72157604532486601/)! Ah snow on the beach, **Mark Wilson**, **Kamran & Ellie Khan**, **Katie** and I very much enjoyed pelting each other with snowballs. \n\nBut by far the best thing about April was going to the [Scilly Isles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isles_of_Scilly). It was hard to believe that just over a week before we'd had snow as, when we got there, it was hot hot hot! **Sea Legs** (heretofore know as **Cath Hyslop**), **Katie**, **Katie's Mum** and I all spent a week in Sea Leg's Mum's cottage. Katie and Cath had years of family holiday history on the tiny islands, and had spent 6 months living and working on Scilly before traveling Australia for a year - So they knew most of the locals, but best of all knew all the best pubs. \n\n{% include figure.html class=\"pull-both\" set=\"waa\" %}\n\n## May\n\nThe start of *some* warm weather prompted me to take the plunge and invest in some running shoes. And, needless to say, I was less than delighted when my first efforts yielded a total distance of 100 yards and a collapsed lung. Over the coming months though I did get *slightly* better, and having run an impressive _slightly further_ I took the decision to enter a half marathon in February 2009. Which, actually, now I come to think about it is not very far off at all...Oh dear. \n\nMeanwhile, our lovely (and by this I mean not at all a bunch of money-grabbing jobs-worths) letting agents had informed us that the landlord wanted to sell Cherrytree and we had to move out at the end of July. The hunt was on to find a new place where I, **Matt Heaton**, **Matt Clegg** and **Steve Clark** could live. Not too much effort went into this initially, after all how hard could it be to find a four bedroom house for let in [Walsall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walsall)? To four, very, _very_ clean living young gentlemen... \n\n## June\n\n June went by in a blur. We still weren't putting in too much effort on the house front, it was hot and not a time for sitting in writing blog posts. So consequentially I can't recall anything that happened. Maybe the best solution for June would be a sign saying: \"scene deleted\". \n\n## July\n\n July was a month of big decisions. We still couldn't find a place to live, and the time was quickly drawing near when we'd have to say goodbye to our beloved Cherrytree. A place in a shared house became available in [Littlehampton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Littlehampton) (aka LA), and it seemed to be a no-brainer. It was certainly a lot closer to Katie than Walsall. But in typical Jon Roobottom style I couldn't decide what to do for the best. This was it, if I moved it meant I really liked this girl. \n\nThanks to the sterling efforts of **Dan Mayley**, and praying more than ever before, I finally saw the light and took the plunge. It was around this time that Glaxstar offered me a deal whereby I'd go freelance, but they'd guarantee me hours for a considerable block of time. How could I not? I'd been itching to get my teeth into some freelance stuff for months - I bit their arm off. God is good. \n\nA week before I left I went camping in [Coed y Brenin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coed-y-Brenin), Wales with some old mates; **Paul Lloyd**, **Kris Benbow**, **Jon Ford**, **Lewis Burden**, **Lee Nash**, **Dave Handley**, **Mark Gosling** and **Jon Macey**. Awesome is all I can say, it came at just the right time. Let's hope we can do it again in 2009. \n\nThe day before I left **Hannah Kemp** threw me a party at chez-kemp. Having spent the last 4 years in Walsall Community Church, this was above and beyond the best send off I could have asked for. Guys, each and every one of you has made Walsall special, and I really can't express what it meant to me to have you all there for the party. Chatting, drinking, relaxing and eating part cooked bbq spare ribs with each one of you is an absolute pleasure. \n\n**Matt H**, **Matt C**, **Adam**, **Steve**, **AJ**,** Kemp**, **Hannah**, **Minnie**, **Esther**, **Sarah**, **Dan & Erin**, **Andy & Sue**, **Raz**, **Paul**, **Lee**, **Kirsty**, **Katy & Ben**, **Lou** and **Paul & Esta**... Thanks for turning up to say goodbye... or maybe just making sure I leave. So on Saturday 26th July 2008 **Kemp**, **AJ**, **Steve** and I packed up a big van and moved my stuff into my new house.\n\n## August\n\nI love the summer, and August didn't disappoint for once - or it may have done, depending on how reliable my memory is. But I recall August as hot. Katie and I travelled back to my **Mum & Dad**'s place in Walsall for his 60th birthday. I think he ended up paying for the meal, so, thanks dad. \n\n{% include figure.html class=\"pull-both\" set=\"dadsbday\" %}\n\nIt was also the big fruits' birthday, so we celebrated **Angie Tuffill** being another year older in style with an American themed party. I think prizes went to **Kamran Khan** for the best costume as [Uncle Fester](http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/2908969397), although he's not a million miles away from that normally. \n\nI also got to relive my youth by finally getting to see [The Levellers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Levellers) live at [Arundel Castle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arundel_Castle). By the looks of some of the older gentlemen in the crowd, they'd been reliving their youth from just after lunch and by 8pm they'd relived so much they were probably going to regret that one in the office on Monday morning. \n\n{% include figure.html class=\"pull-both\" set=\"levellers\" %}\n\n## September\n\nSeptember saw **Annie & Christian Powell** get hitched, which was good news for all of us as we knew they'd throw a decent party. And they didn't disappoint, with not one wedding party but two. Apparently the rave on Sunday night went on till 3am. I'm sure the 3 huge barrels of ale that Christian had invested in helped there. \n\n**Kamran Khan** and I decided to service my car, I mean, how hard could it be? We got all the stuff and set about the task. 6 hours later we'd changed the air filter, just about managed to swap the spark-plugs and put a hole in the drivers side floor. Well, I say \"we\", but the hole was mainly my fault. Still, my car seemed to run all the sweeter for our efforts.\n\n{% include figure.html class=\"pull-both\" set=\"service\" %}\n\n**Cath Hyslop** got baptised! Admittedly I was supposed to get dunked too, but I'm not all that great at making decisions. \n\n{% include figure.html class=\"pull-both\" set=\"cathbap\" %}\n\n## October\n\nOctober is **Katie**'s birthday month, and in true southern style we and a *few* others went for an all you can eat Chinese. I feel we really didn't take full advantage of the 'all you can eat-ness' of the thing, especially Katie who powered her way through starters only... Well, OK she had about 2 tonnes of fried seaweed, but that's not the point. \n\nThe month was also memorable for a day trip Katie and I took to London. I'd been to London so much for work related stuff over the last few months, it was really nice to spend some time (and LOTS of money) exploring the city. \n\n{% include figure.html class=\"pull-both\" set=\"bigben\" %}\n\nOctober was also the month when our new [cell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_group) really took off. I'd arrived in LA at a point where the cell-group was in flux, **Claire Jones** had decided to take a well earned break from her leadership role and we were waiting for a someone to step into the breach. But in October we decided that we'd take our cell in a new direction, each week we'd take it in turns to lead with whatever God had put on our hearts to share. So far it's worked extraordinarily well.\n\n## November\n\nNovember was awesome because of the [WCC](http://www.walsallcommunitychurch.org/) men's weekend away at Standlake Ranch in Oxfordshire. Like the weekend away in 2007 it was an amazing time with God, and He did so much in my life that weekend, perfectly building on the previous year with perfect timing for everything that was going on in my life. \n\n{% include figure.html class=\"pull-both\" set=\"toads\" %}\n\n**Flix & Maryanne Gillett** got hitched too! Gotta say guys the bangers and mash was inspired, and Flix's speech is possibly one of the best I've ever heard. \n\n## December\n\nThe early part of December saw **Katie** and **Cath** jetting off to Hong Kong \"Hongers\" for a few days. Was I jealous? Yeah, a little, but I flippin' hate flying with a passion so avoiding the 12 hour flight was some small consolation. \n\nLater in the month **Katie** and I took a week's holiday in Scotland. I'd told her that I'd booked a B&B and found a suitably crappy looking random guest house on the internet to fool her with. I'd actually booked a private cottage with a hot tub as I'd hatched a bit of a plan. When we got there, the post code on the cottage website took us to some random housing estate. Not to worry I thought, it can't be far, I'll just drive around til we happen upon it. An hour later I was getting a little stressed as all my plans for a surprise were rapidly going down the toilet. In the end I had to confess all and Katie knocked doors until we found someone who'd heard of the place. \n\nWhen we eventually arrived at the cottage I thought I'd booked (as there we're two on the website, a one bedroom place and a three bedroom place) the lights were on, and we could here voices in the garden. \"Hello?\" I shouted as I walked around to the rear of the cottage. I was really fuming now, over an hour to find the place and the owners had double booked it! \n\nI was greeted with sight of a naked couple in the hot tub, she quickly moved, but he just sat there, and I couldn't help but glance at the thing that was floating in the crystal clear, illuminated, water. \"Erm...\" I said, \"Have you booked this place, cos I think I have\". He was actually quite polite, and as we made a quick exit we noticed that the driveway continued on to a larger property just around the corner. In my haste and annoyance I hadn't realised that the place I'd booked was actually the three bedroom cottage. Oh well, you live and learn. \n\nThat night, Katie and I relaxed with a bottle of wine and the promise of the hot tub bubbling away outside. I couldn't wait any longer, she was clearly impressed with the way I'd handled the naked man and the iron was hot to strike. I sat her down, got on one knee and asked her if she'd be my wife. \"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.... really?!\" she said. And then just kept on saying it. Eventually I had to ask her if that was a 'yes'. The ring didn't fit, we'd seen too much nakedness, and all we had for dinner was fish fingers and chips. But it didn't matter, the place was brilliant, and she'd said yes. I couldn't be happier. \n\n{% include figure.html class=\"pull-both\" set=\"ring\" %}\n\nAs 2008 drew to a close, 17 of us played a murder mystery and then on **Florrie Fuller**'s suggestion we played musical statues to the small hours. Thanks to everyone who made my year so awesome, you know who you are (even if you're not mentioned by name here). Here's to a brilliant 2009, and look out for your wedding invites coming to a post box near you sometime in '09...

I’d been to London so much for work related stuff over the last few months, it was really nice to spend some time (and LOTS of money) exploring the city. </p>\n<p>{% include figure.html class=”pull-both” set=”bigben” %}</p>\n<p>October was also the month when our new <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_group\">cell</a> really took off. I’d arrived in LA at a point where the cell-group was in flux, <strong>Claire Jones</strong> had decided to take a well earned break from her leadership role and we were waiting for a someone to step into the breach. But in October we decided that we’d take our cell in a new direction, each week we’d take it in turns to lead with whatever God had put on our hearts to share. So far it’s worked extraordinarily well.</p>\n<h2 id=\"november\">November</h2>\n<p>November was awesome because of the <a href=\"http://www.walsallcommunitychurch.org/\">WCC</a> men’s weekend away at Standlake Ranch in Oxfordshire. Like the weekend away in 2007 it was an amazing time with God, and He did so much in my life that weekend, perfectly building on the previous year with perfect timing for everything that was going on in my life. </p>\n<p>{% include figure.html class=”pull-both” set=”toads” %}</p>\n<p><strong>Flix &amp; Maryanne Gillett</strong> got hitched too! Gotta say guys the bangers and mash was inspired, and Flix’s speech is possibly one of the best I’ve ever heard. </p>\n<h2 id=\"december\">December</h2>\n<p>The early part of December saw <strong>Katie</strong> and <strong>Cath</strong> jetting off to Hong Kong “Hongers” for a few days. Was I jealous? Yeah, a little, but I flippin’ hate flying with a passion so avoiding the 12 hour flight was some small consolation. </p>\n<p>Later in the month <strong>Katie</strong> and I took a week’s holiday in Scotland. I’d told her that I’d booked a B&amp;B and found a suitably crappy looking random guest house on the internet to fool her with. I’d actually booked a private cottage with a hot tub as I’d hatched a bit of a plan. When we got there, the post code on the cottage website took us to some random housing estate. Not to worry I thought, it can’t be far, I’ll just drive around til we happen upon it. An hour later I was getting a little stressed as all my plans for a surprise were rapidly going down the toilet. In the end I had to confess all and Katie knocked doors until we found someone who’d heard of the place. </p>\n<p>When we eventually arrived at the cottage I thought I’d booked (as there we’re two on the website, a one bedroom place and a three bedroom place) the lights were on, and we could here voices in the garden. “Hello?” I shouted as I walked around to the rear of the cottage. I was really fuming now, over an hour to find the place and the owners had double booked it! </p>\n<p>I was greeted with sight of a naked couple in the hot tub, she quickly moved, but he just sat there, and I couldn’t help but glance at the thing that was floating in the crystal clear, illuminated, water. “Erm…” I said, “Have you booked this place, cos I think I have”. He was actually quite polite, and as we made a quick exit we noticed that the driveway continued on to a larger property just around the corner. In my haste and annoyance I hadn’t realised that the place I’d booked was actually the three bedroom cottage. Oh well, you live and learn. </p>\n<p>That night, Katie and I relaxed with a bottle of wine and the promise of the hot tub bubbling away outside. I couldn’t wait any longer, she was clearly impressed with the way I’d handled the naked man and the iron was hot to strike. I sat her down, got on one knee and asked her if she’d be my wife. “Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa…. really?!” she said. And then just kept on saying it. Eventually I had to ask her if that was a ‘yes’. The ring didn’t fit, we’d seen too much nakedness, and all we had for dinner was fish fingers and chips. But it didn’t matter, the place was brilliant, and she’d said yes. I couldn’t be happier. </p>\n<p>{% include figure.html class=”pull-both” set=”ring” %}</p>\n<p>As 2008 drew to a close, 17 of us played a murder mystery and then on <strong>Florrie Fuller</strong>‘s suggestion we played musical statues to the small hours.

If it has a thinner tail end, tuck it under. Spoon half of the watercress mixture onto the salmon. Now fold the pastry over into a neat parcel (the join will be at the top, so trim the edge neatly), making sure you don't have any thick lumps of pastry as these won't cook through properly. \n\nTrim off any excess as you need to. Make 3 neat cuts in the pastry to allow steam to escape and make some decorations with the off-cuts to disguise the join if you like. Brush with the egg glaze.\n\nBake for 30 minutes or until the pastry is crisp and browned. To test whether the salmon is cooked, push a sharp knife through one of the cuts into the flesh, wait for 3 seconds then test it against the inside of your wrist; if it is hot, the salmon is cooked.
