Modules are the smallest building blocks of this site. Many can be stacked together inside `grids` and `containers`, and they can utilise `utilities`. 

They cannot be broken down into smaller patterns, they are self contained with styles that donâ€™t rely on the cascade. In special circumstances, the cascade is permitted to modify their styles, but this is kept to a minimum to maintain their block-like nature.
