It’s a chance for our clients to get together and listen to some fantastic speakers from all areas of Education.</p><p>Part of the draw, <em>we hope</em>, is to see what’s coming next in Firefly. <a href='https://twitter.com/j0ejack'>Joe</a> does his “Steve Jobs” and wows the crowd with the top-secret features we’ve been working on in the preceding months. This year was particularly crowd pleasing as we announced the next major version of our software: Firefly 6.</p>"
